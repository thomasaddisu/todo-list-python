# 📝 Simple To-Do App by Thomas Addisu

A simple **command-line To-Do List application** built with **Python 3**.  
This project helps you manage your daily tasks — you can **add, delete, view, and mark tasks as done** — all from your terminal.  
Your tasks are saved locally, so you won’t lose them even after restarting the program.
